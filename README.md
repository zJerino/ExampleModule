this is a resource developed by zJerino
My goal is to help people or developers to create their own modules for NamelessMC v2 pre7 as I have seen that many people want to know how to make a module to do custom things.

I have tried to comment on everything important to create a module and facilitate the creation process

It is not necessary that you add credits but if not I will thank you: p

If you have questions or doubts, ask them by private message, since I cannot answer them in the comments.

It is important that you know at least some basic php to create the module or at least that you know what you want to do


I will wait for your positive reviews :D and Thank you for shopping!

There is a page in the Namleess wiki that explains more about the classes and functions of Nameless, you can go to see it in the following link
